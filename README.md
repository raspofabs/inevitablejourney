my way around the outskirts of Walnut Forest and found myself within
sight of Stamblemouth. After a short trek, I needed some refreshment,

for a while, and I learned that they worked at St Stephen's, the local
church for Stamblemouth. He mentioned that some of the congregation
were originally from Stowham, and offered to take me home.
