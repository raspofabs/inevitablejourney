A tale told by a computer about a walk that needed to be taken.

I was on my way to the shops, and they were closed, and I had my
stuff, so I thought, I'll just go to the next town; make an adventure
out of it, and it turned into this. I left Leedlelanding behind,
travelling down hill, following the flow of the Stamble. It was nice
out, and the going was easy. I should have realised that I would end
up at Sunrise Woods, but it came up on me by surprise. It jogged my
memory of Samuel. He loved climbing trees as a kid. He was stuck up a
tree while I was nearby, and I tried to help him out. He landed on me
and it was hilarious. Not at the time, but that's when he started
really treating me like a big brother. Samuel spent quite a bit of
time in and around Sunrise Woods when he was younger; there are still
some carvings to prove it too.

I made my way around the outskirts of Sunrise Woods and found myself
within sight of Baggleford. After a short trek, I needed some
refreshment, and found it at The Railway where I met a nice fellow. We
chatted for a while, and I learned that they worked at St Matthew's,
the local church for Baggleford. He mentioned that some of the
congregation were originally from Leedlelanding, and offered to take
me home.
