I don't recollect truly my reasons for starting this journey, but I
know I had this great urge to do so. I left Riddle on the Doddle
behind, travelling down hill, following the flow of the Doddle. It was
nice out, and the going was easy. I should have realised that I would
end up at Hunters Woods, but it came up on me by surprise. It jogged
my memory of Amber. She loved climbing trees as a kid. She got stuck
up a tree at one point, and I had to help her out. She was alright,
but I think that was when she started really treating me like a big
brother. Amber spent quite a bit of time in and around Hunters Woods
when she was younger; there are still some carvings to prove it too.

I made my way around the outskirts of Hunters Woods and found myself
within sight of Crang on the Pamble. After that short trek, I needed
some refreshment, so went in search of it. I stumbled across The Fox,
which was just the right kind of place. While waiting to be served, I
met a nice girl by the name of Megan. She was just setting down to
have some lunch herself. We chatted for a while, and I learned that
she worked at St John's Community Church, which was the local church
for most of the people from Crang on the Pamble. She mentioned that
some of the congregation were originally from Riddle on the Doddle,
and offered to take me home. It took this offer to bring about the
realisation that I was not going to return.

I finished up, said goodbye to Megan, then left The Fox. I walked
through the village for a bit while my mind wandered. Amber was always
doing this. She was always starting something, and just when you
thought she would give up, she would change tactics, or redouble her
efforts, and forge on. She always had a goal. A distant horizon to aim
at. That was the main difference between us, I always thought. There
she was, always taking steps towards a goal, and there was I, taking
steps. Now, it's I taking the steps towards a goal. What that goal is,
I wasn't sure at the time, but I knew it was away from Riddle on the
Doddle, so I started by doing precisely that. Leaving by the opposite
road out of the village of Crang on the Pamble.

As I suspected, I quickly ran into a hill locally known as Pamble
hill, and had to retrace my steps a little. I found a gentle path over
it and made progress. The walk was good and the going was easy as I
was barely carrying anything. I must have been walking for nearly
twenty minutes with nothing but the birds and crickets to keep me
company. At some point, I saw a car coming the other way, and they
stopped to see if I was alright. The lass driving seemed to think I
was lost. I assured her that I was fine, and they drove off. I
realised that Amber had asked me the same thing a number of times. Was
I lost. Though she had asked it in a more philosphical way.
