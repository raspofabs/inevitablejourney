A tale told by a computer about a walk that needed to be taken.

I'd been putting it off my whole life really. Never one for walking
very far. But now seemed to be the right time. I left Piddlebridge
behind, travelling down hill, following the flow of the Piddle. It was
nice out, and the going was easy. I should have realised that I would
end up at Green Forest, but it came up on me by surprise. It jogged my
memory of Molly. She loved climbing trees as a kid. She got stuck up a
tree at one point, and I had to help her out. She was alright, but I
think that was when she started really treating me like a big brother.
Molly spent quite a bit of time in and around Green Forest when she
was younger; there are still some carvings to prove it too.

I made my way around the outskirts of Green Forest and found myself
within sight of Greater Nobblepool. I'd been to Greater Nobblepool
before a while back, but couldn't remember much about it, so I was
pleasantly surprised that as I approached, I was able to remember
enough to find a place to get a bit to eat. I had remembered that the
The Royal Oak was a nice place, so headed there. As I was sorting
through my bits, a nice woman introduced herself as Maddison and we
started talking about Greater Nobblepool. It was nice to pass a little
time. I learned that she regularly attended St Bartholemew's and how
she had been roped into helping drive some of the congregation to
Piddlebridge on shopping trips. She then offered to take me back home.
It was at precisely this point that I realised that I wasn't going
back

I finished up, said goodbye to Maddison, then left The Royal Oak. I
walked through the village for a bit while my mind wandered. Molly was
always doing this. She was always starting something, and just when
you thought she would give up, she would change tactics, or redouble
her efforts, and forge on. She always had a goal. A distant horizon to
aim at. That was the main difference between us, I always thought.
There she was, always taking steps towards a goal, and there was I,
taking steps. Now, it's I taking the steps towards a goal. What that
goal is, I wasn't sure at the time, but I knew it was away from
Piddlebridge, so I started by doing precisely that. Leaving by the
opposite road out of the village of Greater Nobblepool.

As you leave Greater Nobblepool, you always have to travel the road
that leads alongside Moss Woods. It's a pleasant woods, but it's
probably the reason why the village hasn't grown as much as it could.
The walk was good and the going was easy as I was barely carrying
anything. I must have been walking for nearly twenty minutes with
nothing but the birds and crickets to keep me company. I walked past a
little road side cafe at some point. The lass at the counter asked if
I was lost, but I assured them I was just taking a walk. She wished me
well, and I continued on my way. I realised that Molly had asked me
the same thing a number of times. Was I lost. Though she had asked it
in a more philosphical way.

The scenery was lovely, but the day was wearing on. I had enjoyed the
walk, but I needed to find somewhere to stay for the night. When I got
to the junction, I decided to make my way to Hang on the Sten as it
wasn't too far and was still heading away from Piddlebridge. It had
been a long time since I had completed a trek as long as the one I was
planning, so I was pleased to see that the village was furnished with
a market street, which I would utilise in the morning in preparation
for the rest of my trip. There weren't any obvious hotels, but when I
asked at the The Black Horse, they were surprised I didn't know they
provided overnight stays. I wasn't sure, but took a room nonetheless.
As it turns out, the man behind the bar was related to the lass I met
on the road. They had lived around this way for all their lives. Much
like Molly and I, but they had never left Hang on the Sten. Sticking
in one place never seemed likely for Molly It wasn't a fault though,
it was a sense of adventure that drove her.
